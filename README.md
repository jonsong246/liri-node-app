# liri-node-app

Liri is an app that utilizes node.js to find information on movies, songs, and concerts.

Commands:

spotify-this-song "song"
movie-this "movie"
concert-this "artist"

The following video shows a demonstration of the app. (I have currently hit the OMDB API Limit and get values returned as "undefined")
